## Introduction
This project is a social media platform, designed to allow users to share photos, follow other users, like and comment on posts, and interact within a community. The platform is developed with a focus on user experience and scalability, making it suitable for a college social network. Key features include user authentication, profile management, photo uploads. This project showcases skills in full-stack development, RESTful APIs.

## Requirements  
- Software and Tools
   - Node.js and npm: Required to run the frontend and backend. Download from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en).
   - Database:
     - MongoDB: Ensure MongoDB is installed locally or set up a MongoDB Atlas account for cloud hosting.
   - GitHub Desktop: To manage project source code.  
## Installation 
## Front-end
To run your frontend code locally using npm, follow these steps:
1. Ensure Node.js and npm are Installed
     First, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and npm installed. You can check by running:
   
   ```bash
     node -v
     npm -v
    ```
    If these commands return version numbers, Node.js and npm are installed.
3. Navigate to Your Project Directory
    Open a terminal or command prompt, then use cd to navigate to the root folder of your project:
   
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
4. Install Dependencies
   Run the following command to install all dependencies listed in your package.json file:
   
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
6. Start the Development Server
   Once dependencies are installed, start your development server by running:
   
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This command typically starts a server on http://localhost:3000 by default. You can open     
   this URL in your browser to view your site.
## Back-end
For Backend, you will need Node.js, Expressjs, MongodB, installed in your environement.  
- Node 
  - Node installation on Windows
    Just go on official [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) website and download the installer. Also, be sure to have git available in your PATH, npm might need it (You can find git here).
  - Node installation on Ubuntu
    You can install nodejs and npm easily with apt install, just run the following commands.
    
    ```bash
    $ sudo apt install nodejs
    $ sudo apt install npm
  - Other Operating System
    You can find more information about the installation on the official [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) website and the official [NPM website](https://www.npmjs.com/).

  If the installation was successful, you should be able to run the following command.
  ```bash
  $ node --version
  v20.15.1

  $ npm --version
  10.7.0
If you need to update npm, you can make it using npm! Cool right? After running the following command, just open again the command line and be happy.
    ```bash
        $ npm install npm -g
    ```
- ExpressJS installation
     ```bash
    $ npm install express
     ```
   You can find more information about the installation on the official [Express website](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html).
- MongoDB
